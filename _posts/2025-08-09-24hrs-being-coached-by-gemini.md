**_Here is the simple premise of the experiment I decided to conduct on my own financial security:_**
 A week ago a friend couldn't stop raving about how effective chatgpt was as an emotional counsellor. For her, the experience of paying â‚¬70 every week for a 45-minute sessions with another human being could be easily replaced by an AI model and a prompt asking:
> Help me get over my recent breakup with my ex.

\
So I thought, people around the world must spend millions in career-coaching or interview-readiness services. **_Could this also be replace by AI? What is the experience like? Would recruiters notice a difference?_**


## The test subject


Me. 27 year-old engineer based in Barcelona. At this moment, I am happy where I am working and I don't have a pressing need to find a job. I mostly apply to companies/positions that look cool and to have interesting conversations with people.

I am not particularly good at interviews, but I can definitely make people laugh. so there's that.

## The company

A global tech company with certainly enough job openings and people working in HR to tell a good candidate from a bad one. At the very least, their volume of applicants means they would have a clear choice to make: Hire pablo, or someone else.

Let's called it Goopple

# The coaches
Let me introduce you to the coaches:
- Gemini 2.5 Pro
- GPT-4.5
- Claude 4
- DeepSeek-R1

It was very important to me to carry these conversation exactly across multiple publicly available models to avoid a common pitfall as seen on many reddit threads:
``Why did you use [Payed model]!? Its answers are garbage. I only use [Other payed model]``

## Interview 1: The prompt

Not much different from other big companies, Goopple send candidates a breakdown of their interview process, core values, and job expectations. The prompt I chose as guidence was:

```
Your role is my personal interview coach who was once a Senior hiring manager at Goopple, a global tech company with billions of users conducting business in [Excerpt from company website].

I will be interviewing for [Job title and description here]

Let's conduct a mock interview to prepare me for my an upcoming first interview. Access my ability to succeed in this role
```


## Interview 2: Like an echo in a cave. A very expensive cave.

## Interview 3: Am i stupid or what

## Conclusion:
